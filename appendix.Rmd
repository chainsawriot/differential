# I. History of Constellation-Specific Intergroup Relations and dual group identities

Mostly overlooked by group threat theory is the dual-process model, combining automatic (implicit) and controlled (explicit) components of attitudes towards outgroups [@devine:1989:S]. The model assumes individuals to have a normative motivation to control their expression of an attitude towards a group, mostly stemming from exterior factors such as social desirability, taboo, or lawful punishment [e.g., @blinder:2013:BAO;@blinder:2018:R]. In case of low motivation for attitude control, implicit and explicit attitudes should be on a similar level, whereas a high motivation for controlling one’s attitudes is expected to lower explicit opinionated expression, with, nevertheless, implicit attitudes possibly staying unchanged or even being heightened [@wilson:2000]. Such normativity is, naturally, context-dependent and can originate from the history of intergroup relations within a specific constellation. For the German case, this should especially affect explicit stigmatization of two specific ethnic and religious groups, namely Jews as well as Roma and Sinti, both being connotated with the German historical guilt through World War II. In line with this, @frindte:2005:ONA found the presence of traditional manifest Antisemitism, but also more recent forms of latent Antisemitism in the German population. This might translate into more implicit forms of negative stereotyping in news coverage, wherefore, we argue that:

*H4: Historic guilt of a country`s ethnic majority group towards an ethnic group is related to (a) low negative explicit and (b) high implicit sentiment in news portrayals of the respective ethnic groups.*

## Dual Group Identities

Finally, we consider the special case of so-called dual identity groups. Hyphenation (e. g. German-Turkish) is used to identify either citizens with dual citizenship, or commonly, to denote combinations of nationalities and ethnicities. This denotes an ambiguous relationship—it can either indicate the compatibility of both categories (“this as well as that”) or the neglect of a person’s full membership in either group (Eidson et al., 2017). In the German case, dual group identities are frequently being used in reference to the largest ethnic and religious minority groups such as German-Russians or German-Turks [@kaya2007german;@rock2002coming]. Since dual identity usually refers to (at least partial) majority ingroup membership, we would expect the explicit sentiment expressed towards such groups to be more positive than towards single-identity ethnic minorities:

*H5: News portrayals of ethnic minority/majority dual-identity groups will have more positive explicit sentiment than single identity ethnic minority groups.*

At the same time, the ambiguities connected to dual identities might be more prevalent within implicit sentiments expressed. While explicit mentions might emphasize compatibility of dual identities, perceived incompatibilities could be expressed as implicit sentiments within news reporting: 

*RQ4: Which implicit sentiment do news portrayals of ethnic minority/majority dual-identity groups have in comparison to single identity ethnic minority groups?*

## Measures

We extracted dual-identity group names in our corpus that have an equivalent single-identity group name (German-Turks, German Russians, German Italians, German Americans, German Iranians, German Moroccans, and German Syrians). Moreover, to test H4, we included three groups in Germany that were systematically killed in the Holocaust by the Nazi regime: Jewish (*Jude*), Sinti (*Sinti*), and Romani (*Roma*) people. 
To test H5 and study RQ4, we retained the data on single identity group names representing Turks, Russians, Americans, Italians, Moroccans, Iranians, and Syrians. Such data was combined with the data on dual identity group names. Similar Bayesian multilevel models were constructed with a dummy variable representing dual identity as the only independent variable.

## Results: Explicit and Implicit Stigmatization of Jewish, Sinti and Romani Groups

Figure 1 shows the mean-centered LSS and NAS of Jewish, Sinti and Romani group names (green) juxtaposed with 30 randomly selected group names (red). The group mean LSS and NAS for the eight group names for Jewish, Sinti and Romani populations are close to zero (mean LSS: -0.3, NAS: 0.04). Thus, there is not enough evidence to support neither H4a nor H4b.

```{r jew, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Fig 1: Explicit and implicit scores of Jewish, Sinti and Romani populations’ group names (green) and other group names (red)", dpi = 72}
knitr::include_graphics("fig2.png")
```

## Results: Explicit and Implicit Stigmatization of Dual Identity Groups

Figure 2 shows the implicit and explicit scores of single- and dual-identity group names. Upon graphical inspection, it appears that the explicit stigmatization scores for dual-identity group names are lower than single identity group names. This is true for German-Russians, German-Syrians, German-Italians, and German-Turks, but not so for German-Iranians, German-Moroccans, and German-Americans. For the implicit stigmatization scores, the picture is more subtle. Bayesian multilevel models, which adjust for individual country differences, suggest Germans with a dual identity are subjected to a higher level of explicit stigmatization (B = -0.49, 89% HDI: -0.94, -0.09, 5.05% in ROPE). This provides no support for H5. Instead, the predicted pattern is reversed. Not enough evidence is available to answer RQ4 (B = 0.26, 89% HDI: -0.17 to 0.67, 16.38%) as the 89% HDI covers 0. Full models are available in Online Appendix IV below.

# VII. Validation of the LSS model

The trained LSS model was used on the validation set of the coded 4500 sentences, which have not been used for preparing the seed dictionaries. 

Among these 4500 sentences, 133 and 56 sentences were coded with fear and admiration respectively.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
pred_tibble <- readRDS("pred_tibble.RDS")
pred_tibble %>% group_by(gt_fear) %>% summarise(mean = mean(score, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% mutate(gt_fear = ifelse(gt_fear, "Coded with fear", "Coded without fear")) %>% rename(fear = "gt_fear", `mean score` = "mean") %>% knitr::kable()
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
pred_tibble %>% group_by(gt_admire) %>% summarise(mean = mean(score, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% mutate(gt_admire = ifelse(gt_admire, "Coded with admiration", "Coded without admiration")) %>% rename(admiration = "gt_admire", `mean score` = "mean") %>% knitr::kable()
```

Bayesian models show the differences are significant.

```{r, results = "asis", warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
val_models <- map(c("fear_val.RDS", "admire_val.RDS"), readRDS)
walk2(c("Fear", "Admiration"), val_models, print2)

# IX. Robustness check: Bootstrap

We implemented the bootstrap method suggested in @antoniak2018evaluating. The mean and SD of NAS based on 20 boostrapped corpora are visualized in Figure 6.

```{r boot, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Fig 6: Bootstrapped NAS scores", dpi = 72, message = FALSE, width = 15, height = 15}
nas_data <- readRDS("nas_data.RDS")
gen_f <- function(model) {
    tibble(score = model$P, word = model$S) %>% left_join((group_df %>% mutate(group_labels = tolower(group_labels))), by = c("word" = "group_labels")) %>% left_join(indie_vars, by = c("group_name" = "country"))
}
terms <- rio::import("Racism independent variables.xlsx") %>% tibble::as_tibble()

indie_vars <- terms %>% select(2, c(6:9), 15)
colnames(indie_vars) <- c("country", "group_size", "group_size_f", "muslim", "gdppc", "distance")
indie_vars %>% filter(!is.na(country)) -> indie_vars

all_res <- readRDS("boot_all_nas.RDS")

purrr::map_dfr(all_res, gen_f) %>% group_by(word) %>% summarise(m = mean(score), sd = sd(score)) %>% ggplot(aes(y = m, x = fct_reorder(word, m))) + geom_point() + geom_errorbar(aes(x = fct_reorder(word, m), ymin = m - sd, ymax = m + sd)) + theme_light() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) + xlab("Word") + ylab("NAS (Bootstrap)") -> gfyourself

ggsave("boot.png", gfyourself, width = 15, height = 15)
knitr::include_graphics("boot.png")
```

Given the variation, we retest our RQ1 and H2b with the word embeddings trained on those 20 bootstrapped corpora. The directions of the effects are the same, albeit a smaller effect in most of the cases.

```{r, results = "asis", warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
walk2(paste0("boot", 1:20, ": GDP"), readRDS("boot_gdp.RDS"), print2)
```

```{r, results = "asis", warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
walk2(paste0("boot", 1:20, ": Distance"), readRDS("boot_distance.RDS"), print2)
```

\newpage

# X. Robust check: Bias Silhouette Analysis

We implemented the Bias Silhouette Analysis [@spliethover2021bias] to quantify the robustness of our fear and admiration words. The robustness scores of all group names are available in Figure 7. The robustness scores are all over 0.6.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Fig 7: Robustness scores", cache = TRUE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 16}
## magick::image_write(magick::image_read_pdf("silo_fig.pdf", density = 300), "silo_fig.png", "png")
## knitr::include_graphics("silo_fig.png")
silo <- rio::import("silo.csv")
ggplot(silo, aes(y = fct_reorder(s, r), x = r)) + geom_point() + xlab("r") + ylab("Group name") + theme_light()
```

\newpage

# XI. Robust check: Missing data

There are missing data in our measurement of cultural distance. To quantify the uncertainties associated with it, we took the approach by @zhou:2010:NBI to study how the missingness impacts our findings on H2a and H2b.

```{r, results = "asis", warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
print2("Imputed, H2a (Cultural distance, Explicit)", readRDS("mi_expl_distance_model.RDS"))
```

```{r, results = "asis", warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
print2("Imputed, H2b (Cultural distance, Implicit)", readRDS("mi_impl_distance_model.RDS"))
```

\newpage

# XII. Document frequency of fear and admiration words

Figure 8 and Figure 9 display the document frequency of fear and admiration words.

```{r fear, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Fig 8: Document frequency of fear words", cache = TRUE, dpi = 72, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 10, cache = TRUE}
fear_words <- readRDS("fear_words.RDS")
tf <- readRDS("tf.RDS")

tf %>% filter(feature %in% fear_words) %>% arrange(df) %>% ggplot(aes(y = fct_reorder(feature, df), x = df)) + geom_point() + xlab("Document Frequency (Log-scaled)") + scale_x_continuous(trans='log2') + ylab("Fear words") + theme_light()
```

```{r admire, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Fig 9: Document frequency of admiration words", dpi = 72, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 16, cache = TRUE}
admiration_words <- readRDS("admiration_words.RDS")
tf <- readRDS("tf.RDS")

tf %>% filter(feature %in% admiration_words) %>% arrange(df) %>% ggplot(aes(y = fct_reorder(feature, df), x = df)) + geom_point() + xlab("Document Frequency (Log-scaled)") + scale_x_continuous(trans='log2') + ylab("admiration words") + theme_light()
```
